# Hospital_appointment_system
This is a website project that will allow patients to book appointments in a hospital. 


Hospitals have a fixed number of slots every day, for example a hospital could have 30 mins slots for each patient. Considering breaks and lunch etc, a hospital can decide what are the timings for the slots every day. An example of the available slots for a day would be

10:00 AM - 10:30 AM
10:30 AM - 11:00 AM
---- 30 mins Break ----
11:30 AM - 12:00 PM
12:00 PM - 12:30 PM
And so onâ€¦

Now only one patient can book a particular slot for a particular day. So if a patient has already booked the 10:00 AM - 10:30 AM slot, then that slot is not available for another patient.
